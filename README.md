# Unity Gamepad Controller Xbox button mapping

Was tired of always searching this and taking me a long time so decided to create this for my own future use and for everyone else who needs it. This is the Unity button mapping for an Xbox 360/Xbox One controller. I guess the one that can cause a bit more confusion before knowing is that DPAD is not actually a button but an axis too.

| Button  | Code  | Observations |
| :------------ |:---------------:| -----:|
| A      | joystick button 0 |  |
| B      | joystick button 1 |  |

| Y      | joystick button 3 |  |
| Left Bumper      | joystick button 4 |  |
| Right Bumper      | joystick button 5 |  |
| View (Back)      | joystick button 6 |  |
| Menu (Start)      | joystick button 7 |  |
| Left Stick Button      | joystick button 8 |  |
